# Data_Centric_Insights
Data Centric Insights Dashboard is an analytical BI solution built to visualize and evaluate sales performance across multiple dimensions.  It empowers businesses to make faster, data-driven decisions using  insights.


## 📌 Problem Statement:-  
 Businesses generate massive sales data from multiple channels (online & offline), cities, payment modes, and product categories. However, decision-makers often struggle to extract actionable insights from scattered data. This lack of visibility leads to:
- Missed opportunities in identifying top-performing regions and products
- Inefficient marketing and discount planning
- Poor customer retention strategies  
- No real-time understanding of sales trends and revenue performance


## 📌 Introduction:-  
Data Centric Insights Dashboard is a unified, analytics-driven platform designed to empower business teams with a clear, real-time view of sales performance.
The dashboard consolidates vital KPIs — total sales, orders, products listed, discount offers, payment transactions, shopping preferences, yearly trends, and customer engagement — into one intuitive interface.
The solution enables leadership, sales, and marketing teams to make faster, data-driven decisions with improved accuracy and measurable outcomes.


## 🧠 Solution:- 
The dashboard converts raw data into meaningful insights, enabling:
- Online vs Offline sales comparison
- Payment mode performance analysis
- New vs Returning customer engagement metrics
- Month-wise revenue trend tracking
- Identification of top-performing products & city clusters
- Visibility into total sales, orders, products listed & discount offers
